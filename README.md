For a frontend engineering i chose to use HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript without any additional frameworks. I opted not to use other frameworks because i wanted to dedicate our time to solidifying our understanding of JavaScript. And with the help of gtihub to store my source code, link to my github page:https://github.com/Saint8083/Pure-Dictionary-.

my project landing page link: https://saint8083.github.io/Pure-Dictionary-/ and my linkedin url: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-victoria-727436267/

The technical Challenges i face through those time was:

a. Fractured internet connection, and Indecisive of what to do, because of my late response to the project

b. The javascript files was a little bit tough because i have a small idea about it.

c. Indecisive of what to use to complete my Application.
